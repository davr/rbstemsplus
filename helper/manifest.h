/* manifest.c: a kept set's manifest, <kept dir>/<name>.manifest, next to its <name>.kept: each

 * helper alone reads it (the bridge reads only .kept files): the estimate uses it to tell which
 * files are still prepared (the file unchanged, every entry still in the cache), and so does the
 * quick check when rekordbox opens. Text, renamed into place whole:
 *
 *   rbstemsplus-manifest 1
 *   helper <helper version>
 *   model <64 hex: the model folder>
 *   playlist <rekordbox's playlist ID, or ->
 *   rate <model runs> <their seconds> <threads>
 *   file <size> <mtime in ns> <complete 0|1> <entries> <path>
 *   <64 hex: an entry's key>              (one line per entry)
 *
 * A path with a newline isn't recorded. */
